# MAS-Project
Multi agents system project
I have 4 problems and three algorithms (from the paper branch and bound deep search first, ida* and my slea that is an evolutionary algorithm adapted for the situation).

These are the 3 files with the 3 algorithms applied on the 4 problems:
- brench and bound = branch and bound algorithm applied on all the 4 problems 
- ida = IDA* algorithm applied on all the 4 problems
- evolutionary algorithm = slea algorithm applied on all the 4 problems

The functions 
- amd project functions = all the functions needed to run the 3 algorithms  

The comparison 
- three model comparison = i took the result regarding the outcomes from here 
- plot builder = it builds the scalability plots
